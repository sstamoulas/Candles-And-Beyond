		<p>Candles & Beyond took flight in January 2020. I started making candles to help cope with the daily life struggles in my life. It was extremely therapeutic for me and I wanted to share this with other people and started selling my scented candles to co-workers and friends. The positive response and smiles on their faces I received from my customers proved to be worth it hence, Candle & Beyond was established.</p>
		<p>Candles & Beyond sells homemade scented soy candles. We offer a variety of scents that will tickle the senses. Candles are made of 100% soy wax and mixed with different fragrances. They are all hand poured with love and into glass jars of varying sizes.</p>
	
		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>Our goal is to bring with every light, peace and harmony and serenity into your home with our fine selected scented candles made with 100% soy wax and mixed with fine quality fragrance oils.</p>
